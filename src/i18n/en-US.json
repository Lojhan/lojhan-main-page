During our conversations, he made me think about several points that I had never stopped to reflect on. We went from recommending reading material to sincere exchanges of experiences — where we got it right, where we got it wrong, what we learned from it. \nWhen I had technical questions, he never gave me the answer straight away. Instead, he encouraged me to experiment, to use a new tool, to get out of my comfort zone. Without a doubt, during the time he mentored me, I took a huge leap in my career. It was a real turning point."

Over time, my interest in IT management became clearer, and the mentoring was fundamental in this process of discovery and transition.\nThe conversations provided direction, broadened my vision of the role of a technical leader, and helped me understand in greater depth the responsibilities of roles such as software architect and tech lead — both from a technical and behavioral perspective. The exchange was even richer because it included real-world application examples, making the learning practical and applicable to everyday life.\nI believe that maintaining this type of active mentoring is essential to support professionals who are in transition or seeking growth, especially those who want to position themselves more strategically within technical teams and take on leadership roles."
